#+TITLE: Dotfiles

Managed with Chezmoi. Currently only really supports macOS, but that might change as I deploy more random Linux images that need my tmux config and not much else. Note that this is basically untested, but is instructed according to my best memory.

#+begin_src bash
brew install chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/loganrios/dotfiles.git
$HOME/.config/macos-setup
brew bundle --file $HOME/.config/Brewfile
bupper; dupper
#+end_src

* Parinfer
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/eraserhd/parinfer-rust.git
cd parinfer-rust
cargo build --release --features emacs
cp target/release/libparinfer_rust.dylib ~/.emacs.d/.local/etc/parinfer-rust/parinfer-rust-darwin.so
#+end_src
