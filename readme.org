#+TITLE: Dotfiles

Managed with Chezmoi. Currently only really supports macOS, but that might change as I deploy more random Linux images that need my tmux config and not much else.

#+begin_src bash
brew install chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/loganrios/dotfiles.git
$HOME/.config/macos-setup
brew bundle --file $HOME/.config/Brewfile
bupper; dupper
#+end_src
